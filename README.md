# NEAT-AI-for-Ping-Pong
A NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies AI made for a basic Ping Pong Game in Python

Used a pre-existing python Ping Pong game and added a NEAT Network to it

The NEAT AI.py is the main program file others are dependencies REQUIRED to use the thing.

You'll need to put the pong folder in your project folder along with everything in it then put the NEAT AI.py and the best.pickle obj in the project folder for the IDE to know that everything in the pong folder is the dependencies.

To play the game just set up the project as described above and then just run the NEAT AI.py

DISCLAIMER: The AI has been trained for 24/25 generations and is hence very good or I am just bad at playing pong :')

Left is me obiviously :)

Note: The ai_training.txt is the info about each generation the AI has trained for. Not nescessary for anything.

Note(1): The neat-checkpoint-24 is just a python object saving the trained AI, in this case an AI that has been trained for 24 generations.

Note(2): The references and resources used for learning how to make this is in the NEAT_AI.py file
