# NEAT-AI-for-Ping-Pong

This is a less trained verison of the AI with less fitness threshold (300) and less generations (15) as compared to the original's 500 and 25.
Although this time I didn't achive the perfect fitness (did get a perfect AI for the entered configs), it is way better to play against.

Bonus Features: Doesn't hurt your ego :)

As you can see, I'm still bad at pong :) But now a good player can actually play against the AI without feeling inadequate :D

(Description is the same as the main one)

A NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies AI made for a basic Ping Pong Game in Python

Used a pre-existing python Ping Pong game and added a NEAT Network to it

The NEAT_AI_the_less_ego_hurting_version.py is the main program file for this one, others are dependencies REQUIRED to use the thing.

You'll need to put the pong folder in your project folder along with everything in it then put the NEAT AI.py and the best.pickle obj in the project folder for the IDE to know that everything in the pong folder is the dependencies.

To play the game just set up the project as described above and then just run the NEAT AI.py

Note: The ai_training.txt is the info about each generation the AI has trained for. Not nescessary for anything.

Note(1): The neat-checkpoint-15 is just a python object saving the trained AI, in this case an AI that has been trained for 15 generations.

Note(2): The references and resources used for learning how to make this is in the NEAT_AI.py file
