# NEAT-AI-for-Ping-Pong
Created a NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies AI for a basic Ping Pong Game in Python

Used a pre-existing python Ping Pong game and added a NEAT Network to it

The NEAT AI.py is the main program others are dependencies.

You'll need to put the pong folder in your project folder along with everything in it then put the NEAT AI.py in the project folder for the IDE to know that everything in the pong folder is the dependencies.

To play the game just set up the project as described above and then just run the NEAT AI.py

DISCLAIMER: The AI has been trained for 24/25 generations and is hence very good :')
